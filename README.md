### Hi there, my name is Victor ðŸ‘‹
I am a software developer and a technology enthusiast. Over the past few years, I have been improving my skills in programming and application development, using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap) on the front end. Additionally, I have experience in creating and working with systems, machine learning algorithms, and AI using Java and Python.
I speak, read, and write in English at an intermediate level, and I strive to study and improve this skill every day.

I graduated as a Computer Technician from the Federal Institute of Minas Gerais â€“ SabarÃ¡ Campus, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems. I'm seeking an internship in the technology field, so if you have an opportunity or know someone who does, feel free to send me a message on LinkedIn.

In my profile you will encounter my projects. Some of them are college activities, some are commissions, and the rest are personal projects.

I am a focused programmer and work very well in a team. I am seeking opportunities to deepen my knowledge in the field and gain more professional experience.

I have experience with Machine Learning algorithms, using Python with several libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, among others.
In addition, I have experience in Web development, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, as well as in systems development with Java.

I hold a Technical degree in Informatics from the Federal Institute of Minas Gerais and I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Systems at the same institution. I was a research scholarship holder in a project involving Data Science and Machine Learning for one year, which resulted in a publication at the XVII SimpÃ³sio Brasileiro de AutomaÃ§Ã£o Inteligente (SBAI 2025).
