### Hi there, my name is Victor ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a programmer seeking for oportunities to deepen in the area and acquire more experience as a professional. I already have experience with Web development, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and with system development, using Java. Besides that, Iâ€™m learning React and Python.

Iâ€™m graduated as a Computer Technician at the Instituto Federal de Minas Gerais - Campus SabarÃ¡ and Iâ€™m currently graduating as a Bachelor in Systems of Information, seeking for an internship in technology, so if you need or know someone who needs one, please send a message in LinkedIn:

In my profile you can see and test some of my projects. Some of them are college activities, some are comissions, and the rest are skill practicing codes.
