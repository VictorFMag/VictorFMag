### Hi there, my name is Victor ðŸ‘‹
I am a software developer and a technology enthusiast. Over the past few years, I have been improving my skills in programming and application development, using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap) on the front end. Additionally, I have experience in creating and working with systems, machine learning algorithms, and AI using Java and Python.
I speak, read, and write in English at an intermediate level, and I strive to study and improve this skill every day.

I graduated as a Computer Technician from the Federal Institute of Minas Gerais â€“ SabarÃ¡ Campus, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems. I'm seeking an internship in the technology field, so if you have an opportunity or know someone who does, feel free to send me a message on LinkedIn.
