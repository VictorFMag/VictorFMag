### Hi there, my name is Victor ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a programmer seeking opportunities to deepen my knowledge in the field and acquire more professional experience. I already have experience in web development, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and in system development, using Java and Python.

I graduated as a Computer Technician from the Instituto Federal de Minas Gerais - Campus SabarÃ¡, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Systems of Information. I'm seeking an internship in technology, so if you need one or know someone who does, please send a message on LinkedIn:

In my profile you will encounter my projects. Some of them are college activities, some are commissions, and the rest are personal projects.
