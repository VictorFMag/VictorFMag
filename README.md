### Hi there, my name is Victor ðŸ‘‹
I am a focused programmer and work very well in a team. I am seeking opportunities to deepen my knowledge in the field and gain more professional experience.

I have experience with Machine Learning algorithms, using Python with several libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, among others.
In addition, I have experience in Web development, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, as well as in systems development with Java.

I hold a Technical degree in Informatics from the Federal Institute of Minas Gerais and I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Systems at the same institution. I was a research scholarship holder in a project involving Data Science and Machine Learning for one year, which resulted in a publication at the XVII SimpÃ³sio Brasileiro de AutomaÃ§Ã£o Inteligente (SBAI 2025).

In this Github profile, you will encounter some of my projects, which include college activities, commissions, and personal projects.
